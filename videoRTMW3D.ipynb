    "# RTMPose3D Information and Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Model Details\n",
    "This implementation uses **RTMPose3D** from the official [MMPose projects directory](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/projects/rtmpose3d), which provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced 3D Pose Estimation**: Real-time temporal modeling for improved accuracy\n",
    "- **WholeBody Detection**: 133 keypoints total:\n",
    "  - Body: 17 keypoints (COCO format)\n",
    "  - Face: 68 keypoints (facial landmarks)\n",
    "  - Hands: 21 keypoints each (42 total - left + right)\n",
    "  - Feet: 6 keypoints each (12 total - left + right)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time Performance**: Specifically optimized for live video processing\n",
    "- **Temporal Modeling**: Uses multiple frames for more stable 3D pose estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Performance Tips\n",
    "1. **GPU Acceleration**: RTMPose3D benefits significantly from CUDA acceleration\n",
    "2. **Model Variants**: Choose based on your needs:\n",
    "   - `rtmpose3d-s`: Fastest, good for real-time on limited hardware\n",
    "   - `rtmpose3d-m`: Balanced speed and accuracy\n",
    "   - `rtmpose3d-l`: Best accuracy, requires more computational power\n",
    "3. **Input Resolution**: 384x288 is optimal for real-time processing\n",
    "4. **Lighting**: Consistent lighting improves 3D depth estimation\n",
    "5. **Temporal Window**: Uses 8 frames by default for temporal modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Troubleshooting\n",
    "- **Model not found**: Ensure you have the latest MMPose version with RTMPose3D\n",
    "- **Slow performance**: GPU acceleration highly recommended for RTMPose3D\n",
    "- **Installation issues**: Use `mim install mmpose` for the complete installation\n",
    "- **Project models**: RTMPose3D models are in the `projects/rtmpose3d/` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 References\n",
    "- **RTMPose3D Project**: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/projects/rtmpose3d\n",
    "- **MMPose Documentation**: https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/\n",
    "- **Original Paper**: Check the RTMPose3D project page for paper references\n",
